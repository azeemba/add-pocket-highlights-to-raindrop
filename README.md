# Add Pocket Highlights to Raindrop

Raindrop supports importing Pocket's data for links and tags but no way to support highlights.
The data didn't exist till recently so its not surprising.

This project uses the raindrop APIs to upload the highlights.

You will need to create a developer application at https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations
